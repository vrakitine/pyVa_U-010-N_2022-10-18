VAOP example in Python 

This program is calculating a sum of positive elements of array. Perhaps it is biggest program in Python to solve such simple task. I hawrote this program as an example of using V-agent oriented programming (VAOP) metology.

It is easy to see that when you change the va-script and add new actions, you can solve problems of unlimited complexity.
