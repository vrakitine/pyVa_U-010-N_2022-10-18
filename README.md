VAOP example in Python 

This program is calculating a sum of positive elements of array. Perhaps it is biggest program in Python to solve such simple task. I wrote this program as an example of using V-agent oriented programming (VAOP) methodology.

In this example I am also first time introducing my innovation of  "three dot notation" in name of VAOP-engine variables

It is easy to see that when you change the va-script and add new actions, you can solve problems of unlimited complexity.
